    <h1>Playing with Images</h1>
    <h2>Basic Image with alt and title attributes</h2>

    <p>The MDN web docs has a great introduction to
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">
        Responsive images</a>. Please read that for additional tips.</p>

    <p>The basic syntax for adding an image
    is to use the <code>img</code> element.
    It's also important to add an
    <code>alt</code> attribute that describes the
    image for screen readers.
    The <code>title</code> attribute is
    optional but can be used to show a
    title of the image when a mouse
    cursor hovers over.</p>

    <img src="images/puzzle.png"
      alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
      title="A wooden puzzle box">

    <h2>Changing the width and height</h2>

    <p>We can use the
    <code>height</code> and
    <code>width</code>
    attributes to resize an image.
    However, it's better to change
    the height and width in a photo editor,
    like Photoshop or Gimp, instead.
    This is because despite the change here,
    the original file may be large,
    and it's better to avoid transmitting
    large files over the internet when possible.
    We don't always know what kind of
    internet connection people may have.
    Keep files as small as possible.</p>

    <p>Changed the height to 71:</p>

    <img src="images/puzzle.png"
      alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
      title="A wooden puzzle box"
      height="71">

    <p>Changed the height to 142:</p>

    <img src="images/puzzle.png"
      alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
      title="A wooden puzzle box"
      height="142">

    <p>Changed the width to 84:</p>

    <img src="images/puzzle.png"
      alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
      title="A wooden puzzle box"
      width="84">

    <p>Changed the width to 252:</p>

    <img src="images/puzzle.png"
      alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
      title="A wooden puzzle box"
      width="252">

    <h2>Responsive design with image</h2>

    <p>Using the above methods
    to set the size of an image is
    not altogether responsive, either.
    In order to
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">
    make an image responsive to different screen sizes</a>,
    we can use the
    <code>srcset</code> and
    <code>sizes</code> HTML attributes
    to list optional size images to display
    depending on screen size.
    This allows the browser to
    load different size images depending
    on the size of the screen.
    This has other bandwidth implications.
    Some people may be on mobile devices,
    and therefore may have
    slower internet connections.
    Using a smaller image file will cause the
    smaller image to load first,
    and therefore, faster on such devices.
    The <code>src</code> attribute is used
    here as a fallback device,
    in case <code>srcset</code>
    does not work.</p>

    <p>I only list two sizes here,
    but more could be added to adjust for different
    file and screen sizes.</p>

    <img srcset="images/puzzle-252w.png 252w,
                 images/puzzle-504w.png 504w"
         sizes="(max-width: 504px) 252px,
                 504px"
         src="images/puzzle-504w.png"
         alt="A picture of a puzzle box">

    <h2>External images</h2>

    <p>As we've already seen,
    we can source an image file on another site.
    Be careful not to violate copyright when doing so.
    Here's I source an image file
    from Wikipedia.</p>

    <p>We use the
    <code>figure</code> and
    <code>figcaption</code>
    when we want to
    isolate an image as important.
    We might use these HTML
    elements in certain
    kinds of documents,
    like news articles or scholarly papers.</p>

     <figure>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Neferefre.jpg"

      alt="A statue of Neferefre Isi, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period"

      title="A statue of Neferefre Isi, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period">

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Images with Styling</h2>

    <p>Here I add a <code>class</code>
    attribute to the image specify this
    particular image in the HTML and
    add some styling to it,
    like a pink border and a shadow:</p>

    <img class="image-style"
      srcset="images/puzzle-252w.png 252w,
              images/puzzle-504w.png 504w"
      sizes="(max-width: 503px) 252px, 504px"
      alt="A picture of a puzzle box"
      src="images/puzzle-504w.png">

  <section>
  <h2>Background Images</h2>

  <p>Background images can be
  applied over the background of a
  particular part of a page,
  like this <code>section</code> here,
  or to the entire page using the
  <code>body</code> elcodeent.</p>

  <p>The code for something like
  that would look like the code below.
  Note I use <code>url</code> and
  not <code>src</code> to set the file location.
  The <code>url</code> here is called a
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions">
    CSS reference function</a>,
  unlike <code>src</code>,
  which is a HTML attribute.
  We only use <code>src</code> for
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes">
  specific HTML elements</a>
  like the <code>img, audio, video</code> elements.</p>

  <p>In the example below,
  I placed file in the bottom right corner,
  but you can do more,
  including repeating an image or
  placing it in different locations.
  See:
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp">CSS3
  Background Image</a>.</p>

  <pre>
  <code>
    section {
    background-image: url(images/littlesquare.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right bottom;
    }
  </code>
  </pre>
